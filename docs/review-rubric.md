# ORI Review Rubric

_Designed such that both giver & receive gain useful information._

**A+** - "this information is true, useful, AND it is novel to me"

**B** - "this information is true & useful, but I already knew this. Worth spreading though"

**U** - "this doesn't seem right. Either you don't understand this, or I don't understand you"

### How to use this for levelling 

Give me something at the edge of your knowledge, and I will rate it **A+/B/U**.

- If you are "too far ahead" of me, then the edge of your knowledge will get a **U** from me (because I don't get it).
- If you are "too far below", it will also get a **U** (because your knowledge is incorrect, and I don't know how to show that to you)

The goal is to "binary search" until we can at least find common ground, i.e. can exchange mutual **B**'s. 

If you can give me an **A+** this is a win for me, and a successful leveling attempt for you. If I can also give you an **A+** then we are peers.

If only one of us can produce **A+** for the other, then the giver is a mentor. 

Everyone in ORI should connect with someone "one step above" and "one step below". The more people you can level, the more you can accelerate others finding their place.

- [Unfakeable Signals of Good Faith](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/unfakeable-signals-of-good-faith) - I reflect on this protocol of how to make every interaction useful, even if the other person is not playing along/implementing this same protocol. This is what makes it REALLY powerful I think, it works assymetrically.
