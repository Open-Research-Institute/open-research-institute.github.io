# ORI Mystic Review Guide (DRAFT)

_TODO: flesh out this protocol of how people who practice "rigorous intuition" can review each other. This requires some prereqs, like understanding what "rigorous intuition" even means_

- "does this resonate?" (do you FEEL anything, or does not trigger any feelings)
- "in which direction does this resonate?" (do you love this, or do you HATE it)
- "is it clear or diffuse?" (mixed signals?)
- "what does this bring up?"

Goal is to distinguish these cases:

(A) I feel a strong feeling, and it's very clear (ex: "i love this")
(B) I feel a LOT of feelings, but they're in different directions 

_NOTE: if you feel "a new feeling" you have no calibration on it! In order to give useful information, you sort of need to have felt the feeling before, and then SEEN what has played out! This is an important of mystic training. Calibrating!!_
