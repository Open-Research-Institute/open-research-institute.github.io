#### **Defender** (https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/)

Ex software engineer / game dev. Two main directions now are (1) evangelizing "open memetics" so that we can do cultural engineering & debugging openly and outcompete those doing it in the dark (2) coordination theory & application, finding problems in civilization where solutions already exist but aren't being used. ORI is an applied example of this. Those on the frontier of science can't find each other, but once they do, major breakthroughs happen. My work with open memetics is also an example of this: the investors existed, the builders & scientists existed, the desire from the masses there (but latent). All I did was do enough science communication to connect all the pieces.

See:

- (layperson, memetics 101) [A Beginner's Guide to Culture Science](defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/a-beginners-guide-to-culture-science)
- [Anatomy of an Internet Argument](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/anatomy-of-an-internet-argument) - this is a protocol for studying cultures, trying to change their mind/spread an idea, and then writing about it in a way that others can reproduce, AND in a way that is fully transparent to both sides.
