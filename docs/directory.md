#### **Defender** (https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/)

Ex software engineer / game dev. Two main directions now are (1) evangelizing "open memetics" so that we can do cultural engineering & debugging openly and outcompete those doing it in the dark (2) coordination theory & application, finding problems in civilization where solutions already exist but aren't being used. ORI is an applied example of this. Those on the frontier of science can't find each other, but once they do, major breakthroughs happen. My work with open memetics is also an example of this: the investors existed, the builders & scientists existed, the desire from the masses there (but latent). All I did was do enough science communication to connect all the pieces.

See:

- [Anatomy of an Internet Argument](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/anatomy-of-an-internet-argument) - this is a protocol for studying cultures, trying to change their mind/spread an idea, and then writing about it in a way that others can reproduce, AND in a way that is fully transparent to both sides.

## Backlog

Backlog of people to include/introduce to ORI. Not everyone in this list endorses or is aware of ORI. They may have yet to be invited/accepted an invitation.

- https://x.com/suntzoogway - formalizing morality, "universal alignment", creating a new scientific field of "philodosy"

> Morality is objective relative to the frame of the subject, ergo it's not objective vs subjective that's a false dichotomy, it's an integration just like w/ einsteins general relativity.
> https://x.com/suntzoogway/status/1924183215285109086

- https://x.com/sunriseoath - ORI's resident Christian theologian, advanced/esoteric theology "from first principles". Theology as a technical, rigorous discipline (closer to math than the humanities)
- David Rug, Project Liminiality, working on [The InterBrain - How Collective DreamWeaving Can Heal the World ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5dBRmjF8mc) - this is a piece of open source infrastructure that acts as a "memetic vaccine" for society if successful, but at the very least is a necessary infra that ORI itself needs.
