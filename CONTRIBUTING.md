# Contributing 

Welcome to ORI! 

1. **Join the Discord, and get a log channel** - this is your "personal workspace" to think out loud or share updates.
1. **Write an "entry point" to your work** - see examples in [directory.md](docs/directory.md). At minimum you should have a "public notebook", ideally a substack or a github repo. Twitter doesn't count (because it's more of the "stream of conciousness" place, you need a place for evergreen writing that others can find & reference) 
1. **Review someone else's work** - everyone in ORI needs a peer. Doesn't have to be within the network. Ideally you want someone "above you" and someone "below you". Reviewing people "above you" / more notable than you gives others an anchor to your work, and gives visibility to your work. Reviewing people "below you" is a public service, but helps surface gems, & helps you crystalize your own thoughts.

Reviews of others work count as a "bridge". Example: [Defender's review of Hank Green](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-hank-green-is-contributing-to) acts as an entry point to Hank Green for those unfamiliar with his work.

- [ORI onboarding book](https://github.com/Open-Research-Institute/onboarding/issues) - this is an attempt to create a "minimum set of concepts" that everyone in ORI understands, that are not yet widely understood in the general public/the frontier of LLMs, and that are necessary to push forward.
- [Defender's notebook GitHub](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/notebook/issues) which serves as a place tracking reviews/active projects. It's technically public but less visibility/broadcasting than twitter or substack
