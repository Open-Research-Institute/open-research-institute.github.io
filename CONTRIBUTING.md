# Contributing 

Welcome to ORI! Here is what we need from you:

- **An "entry point" to your work**.
  - The person who invited you should work with you on this. See examples in [directory.md](docs/directory.md)
- **Join the Discord, and get a log channel.**
  - This is where you can do your work, organize it however you like. Most people use it as a way to transition away from DMing Defender to finding peers & collaborators.
- **Review someone else's work**.
  - Check the [review queue](https://x.com/OpenResearchOrg/status/1950554296744902752) or just look through the latest public work in people's entry points in the [directory.md](docs/directory.md)
  - Feel free to review people "outside the network". This serves two functions (1) contributing useful knowledge / potentially getting you noticed (2) surfacing people to ORI. As an example see [Defender's review of Hank Green](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-hank-green-is-contributing-to) which acts as an entry point to Hank Green for those unfamiliar with his work.   
- **Submit something for review**
  - This is how you find your place in ORI. Bonus points if you can combine this with a review. For example, if someone's work has overlap with yours, but you have a useful piece to contribute, you can make that bridge.
