# Contributing 

Welcome to ORI! 

1. **Join the Discord, and get a log channel** - this is your "personal workspace" to think out loud or share updates.
1. **Write an "entry point" to your work** - see examples in [directory.md](docs/directory.md). At minimum you should have a "public notebook", ideally a substack or a github repo. 
1. **Review someone else's work** - everyone in ORI needs a peer. Doesn't have to be within the network. Ideally you want someone "above you" and someone "below you".

- [ORI review rubric](https://github.com/Open-Research-Institute/open-research-institute.github.io/blob/main/docs/review-rubric.md) for mutually beneficial reviews
  - Reviews of others work count as a "bridge". Example: [Defender's review of Hank Green](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-hank-green-is-contributing-to) acts as an entry point to Hank Green for those unfamiliar with his work.  
- [ORI onboarding book](https://github.com/Open-Research-Institute/onboarding/issues) - this is an attempt to create a "minimum set of concepts" that everyone in ORI understands, that are not yet widely understood in the general public/the frontier of LLMs, and that are necessary to push forward.
- [Defender's notebook GitHub](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/notebook/issues) which serves as a place tracking reviews/active projects. It's technically public but less visibility/broadcasting than twitter or substack
