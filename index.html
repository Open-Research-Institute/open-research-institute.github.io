        <h2>What is ORI?</h2>
        <p>
            It's a template for a trust network of humans working on surfacing & propagating truth.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of ORI is to be the largest open instance of that network. There is no way to compete with ORI, because anyone publishing useful information & predictions publicly is already contributing to ORI.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Resources flow towards any node in the network that makes effective use of that category of resources. Status & attention accrue towards the earliest to originate or surface useful ideas. Capital accrues towards the best execution.  
        </p>

        <p>
            To find your nearest ORI, look for the community that has the best predictions on the internet + a mechanism for you to contribute. 
        </p>

        <br/><br/>
        <h2>What does that mean, practically?</h2>
        <p>
            1. You start out with questions you have about the world. It doesn't matter if the answers exist somewhere; it matters if YOU understand it & can apply it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Once you learn something, you blog or make a video about it, to shorten the path for someone like past you.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. You keep doing this until you can recognize the frontier of human knowledge. Here you either contribute to it, or continue to maintain the channel you've dug.   
        </p>

        <p>
            The proof of work is the work itself. Success is rewarded automatically by its own fruits. Your ability to recognize the frontier allows you to make better life / business decisions. A novel contribution rewards you with attention & status, which can be converted to money, or with money directly.  
        </p>

        <br/><br/>
        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>A scientist</b> who discovers a simple way to solve a problem many people have, and wants someone to take it & apply it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Someone in industry</b> who has a problem, and wants to know if a solution exists, or if this is a useful open problem that scientists would want to know about. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>An investor</b> (or science communicator) who wants to find the next big breakthrough before others do.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>A student</b> who wants to accelerate their learning while simultaneously contributing to the propagation of good ideas in society.
        </p>


        <p>
            The whole system is interdependent. The smart people who solve hard problems cannot contribute to society if their ideas are not propagating.
        </p>
        <p>
            The frontier is bottlenecked by the backtier.
        </p>
